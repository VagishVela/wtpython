# GitHub Action Workflow enforcing our code style.

name: Lint, Build & Deploy

# Trigger the workflow on both push (to the main repository)
# and pull requests (against the main repository, but from any repo).
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '*.py'
      - '.github/workflows/lint.yaml'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '*.py'
      - '.github/workflows/lint.yaml'

# Brand new concurrency setting! This ensures that not more than one run can be triggered for the same commit.
# It is useful for pull requests coming from the main repository since both triggers will match.
